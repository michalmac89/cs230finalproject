Alemtuzumab was administered as induction therapy, and a dual immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus and prednisolone was used as maintenance therapy. Following a complicated post-transplant course, she was discharged 3 months post-operatively. The highest forced expiratory volume at 1 second value was reached in December 2019 with 1.60 liters (72% predicted). On the day of hospitalization (Day 0), she presented to the outpatient clinic for a routine follow-up visit with no apparent symptoms. Lung function testing showed a drop in forced expiratory volume at 1 second to 1.28 liters (57% predicted). Upon questioning, she expressed mild exercise dyspnea and a dry cough but no fever or diarrhea. The patient had no concerning travel history. Immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus 0.6 mg twice daily (trough level was 5—7 ng/dl owing to alemtuzumab induction and history of osteomyelitis), and 5 mg prednisolone daily. Leukocyte count was 11,360 cells/μl (6% lymphocytes), C-reactive protein was 1.0 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase was 297 units/liter, and creatine kinase was 32 units/liter. There was no thrombocytopenia. Arterial blood had a partial pressure of oxygen of 55 mm Hg without supplementation. Real-time reverse transcriptase—PCR (RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 from Altona Diagnostics) of nasal and pharyngeal swabs showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, thereby establishing a diagnosis of COVID-19. She was hospitalized, and a chest X-ray showed chronic post-operative dystelectasis on the left side with some increase in density (Figure 1 ) compared with December 2019. A chest computerized tomography scan showed ground glass opacities mainly in the left lower lobe with left-sided parenchymal consolidation or partial atelectasis (Figure 2 ). Oxygen supplementation with 1 to 2 liters/minute was administered. Antibacterial therapy was empirically started based on suspected bacterial superinfection. Otherwise, no major changes in medication were performed. A detailed medication plan is shown in Table 1 . She remained asymptomatic and remained stable. RT-PCR testing was performed on a weekly basis and remained positive on Day 7 and Day 14. Cycle threshold levels of SARS-CoV-2 E- and S-gene are provided in Table 2 . Cycle threshold values increased at every sample time point, indicating a decrease in virus levels over time. On nasopharyngeal swabs on Day 21, no SARS-CoV-2-RNA could be detected by RT-PCR. No oxygen was required from Day 17 until discharge. The patient was discharged home on Day 21. Figure 1.

At admission time, he had fever up to 38 °C. Peripheral oxygen saturation was 90% with a face mask. No abnormality was seen in laboratory results except positive C-reactive protein, lymphopenia with 570 cells/μL, and severe respiratory acidosis. The chest X-ray imaging revealed bilateral infiltration in both upper and lower lobs (Fig. 1a). The patient had no underlying diseases and history of medicine usage. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sample for COVID-19 was reported positive and according to RT-PCR test and clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made for the patient. The therapeutic regimen included Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 200 mg P.O. BID and lopinavir/ritonavir at a dose of 200/50 mg P.O. BID initiated for the patient. After four days, the clinical condition of the patient was deteriorated and he was subjected to intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The peripheral oxygen saturation decreased to 82%. The chest X-ray imaging showed the progressive infiltration (Fig. 1b) and the patient was categorized as a critically COVID-19 case with remarkable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The plasma level of interlukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured at this time. The results showed high levels of inflammatory cytokines. The urine output also decreased to 200 mL during the last 12 h and creatinine increased to 1.5 mg/dL. At this time, it is decided to start continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT, Prismaflex, Baxter, IL, USA) with disposable hemoperfusion cartridge (HA 380 cartridge, Jafron Biomedical Co., China) due to cytokine release storm and hypoxemia. A Shaldon catheter was inserted and CRRT was done for three sessions. The CRRT modality was continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The replacement fluid volume was removed by 35 mL/kg/h and the pump circulated blood by 250 mL/min. Priming of hemoperfusion was done with saline, and the cartridge was primed in a vertical position with the arterial side facing downward. A bolus dose of 2500 IU of heparin was administered into the arterial line, the cartridge was kept inlet side down, and blood flow through the cartridge was begun. Totally, 6000 IU was needed through the procedure. CRRT was started with a high ultrafiltration rate (200 mL/h). Each cartridge was replaced with a new cartridge after 6 h. The fluid removal rate was decreased to 50 mL/h after 8 h and then to zero mL/h during the last 8 h in the first 24 h. The second and the third sessions of CRRT were conducted by 0 mL/h fluid removal. A 24-h rest between sessions, was considered to avoid the probable coagulopathy and electrolyte abnormality. After three sessions of CRRT plus hemopurification, the clinical condition of the patient was improved with the peripheral oxygen saturation of 95%. The creatinine also decreased to 1.1 mg/dL after the end of CRRT and urine output reached to 70 mL/h. No laboratory abnormality was seen during the CRRT. The chest X-ray revealed recovery of both lungs following the completion of 3 sessions of hemopurification (Fig. 1c). Also, the inflammatory cytokines were measured 48 h following the last session of hemoperfusion and showed a remarkable decrease. IL-1, and IL-6 were decreased from 523.3 pg/mL to 38.25 pg/mL, and 226.35 pg/mL to 210.18 pg/mL, respectively. The measurements also showed the decrease in IL-8 from 886.5 pg/mL to 482.4 pg/mL. Tumor necrosis factor alpha level decreased from 49.5 pg/mL to 47.3 pg/mL at the end of 3 sessions of hemoperfusion.

On February 4, 2020, a 50-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia,” and she was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Fever Clinic of Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College. The patient had a five-day business trip in Wuhan (from January 22, 2020, to January 27, 2020). Fever initially occurred on January 28, 2020, with a body temperature of 38.5°C, with dry cough and muscle ache. On January 30, 2020, the patient went to Xiangyang First People’s Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for consultation in the respiratory department, and the laboratory test reported that the influenza A virus serology was negative. The results of blood routine examination were normal [white blood cell count (WBC): 5.1×109/l; neutrophil percentage (neu%): 69.2%; lymphocyte percentage (lym%): 25.6%; lymphocyte absolute value (lym): 1.28×109/l; C-reactive protein (CRP): 6.1 mg/l] and she was given Tamiflu (75 mg/time, twice per day) orally and was rehydrated. Three days later (on February 2, 2020), the patient still had dry cough, so she went to hospital (TCM) again. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip and a novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was performed and it was negative. At admission, chest X-ray showed increased and thickened right lower lung markings, which suggested bronchitis and possible interstitial pneumonia according to her positive family history of interstitial pneumonia (Figure 1). Levofloxacin was given drip once for intravenous treatment, and Tamiflu was continued to be taken orally. On February 04, 2020, the patient's symptoms were still not improved, and her body temperature continued to rise to 39.2°C. She was referred to our fever clinic for further evaluation, and a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed.
